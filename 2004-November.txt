We need libtar and wget in base ... it's a dep for makepkg. 

Even if our abs works .. it still needs those two . I could not find any
of them in our tree, so I dpb has not uploaded them. 

Also .. how do we get anonymous cvs working with abs on berlios ? 


Cheers

Atm  we have everything needed to make a install cd. 
We have cvs, an addapted pacman, wget and all other deps , even openssh
for cvs'ing with berlios.

I think the next step is best to create our own install cd. So any help
would be very much appreciated .

 as you all know the following is in place = 


install iso is downloadable and working like a charm ( mind those with
SATA a acpi dodgy boxes) thx dpb for good work on the install and build
iso .. kernel source needs to be added ASAP

pacman -Syu && pacman  -s e17 works .. sweet deps .. eye candy if you
have dfbdev in grub enabled or if you have a good xorg config. I'll
remake e16 pkg later  .. 

where is alsa ?   ow boy ow boy .. alsa and sound need to be available ,
later builds will enable it, mind that dbus and hal will ease our pain.


I've informed xentac aout projectdev .. so he knows about the fork


I've filled in the regform on distrowatch .. maybe we get enlisted


freedomzen has joined the test base :-)

Message-ID: <41961875.1090305@email.it>

Hi,

Project dEv finally seems to have an official logo. I made it using only 
the GIMP, and blokkie has already approved it.

You can find a 400x400 png version with transparent background at:
http://utenti.lycos.it/rensel/projectdev/projectdev_logo_2.png

And this is for Mogwa_ (144x104, png with transparent bg) for the website:
http://utenti.lycos.it/rensel/projectdev/projectdev_logo_2_top.png

I hope you like it. I'm going to work on some other stuff like a 
fbsplash for Project dEv, so stay tuned ;)

Amar "Rensel" Hadzihasanovic

I've build and uploaded :

tk
tcl
python
libxml
imagemagick


this is for making screenshots and putting it on the website later

Next on my todo list is :

rebuilding grub to enable fb and fbsplash by default
rebuild bash with a cool bashrc
build mozilla for mail and browsing

(maybe xchat and xmms and xmms2 later for e17 audio player)

Also alsa stuff and HAL , D-bus will come in later if I find the time
today 

Cheers,
Blokkie

Message-ID: <1101132045.6557.19.camel@boss>

<raster> keep working
<raster> :)
<blokkie> will do ,  a rebuild of EFL is happening , and the apps are
expected to be fnished at the end of the week
<raster> dont get so settled
<raster> you shoudl be able to rebuild within like 20 mins
<raster> cvs keeps changing
<blokkie> we have a cvs and a package system that makes rebuilds very
easy
<blokkie> only thing to do is change the source-pkg  and type   makepkg
then upload it again  :-)
<raster> cool
<raster> as good as openembedded?
<blokkie> and if people wanna get the latest greatest source  they just
type in   abs <enter>  and all cvs stuff gets in  /var/projectdev   for
them to devel as they see fit 
* blokkie doesn't know openembedded 
<raster> cool
<raster> i suggest you look at it
<blokkie> will do 
<raster> it builds entirely form source (buidls mebedde d.ipk packgages)
<raster> but
<raster> it even builds its own compiler
<raster> using your current one
<raster> and it builds ina buildroot and can build for any architecture
on your current one
<raster> oemake world
<raster> will build everything (and if appropriate cvs update etc.)
<raster> :)
<blokkie> *grin*  need to check it out 
<blokkie> raster  I still think we will stay with our current shema coz
all the devlopers now know how to use it 
<raster> thats cool
<raster> but u may find some sueful thigns to use from it
<raster> ideas etc.
