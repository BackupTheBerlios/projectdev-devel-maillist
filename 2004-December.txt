Subject: [Projectdev-devel] udev-046-2
Message-ID: <34860.83.100.157.117.1102266863.squirrel@83.100.157.117>

Hello every one.

Myself and MrGreen have resently come across a problem with the udev-046-2
pkg.

If you install this PKG your system will not mount your partitions. we
have yet to identify the exect issues with this PKG. Please do not install
this PKG.

If you have isntalled this PKG and your system is not working you will
need to do the following.
boot off the project dEv cd
mount the cd via
mount /dev/cdroms/cdrom /src
mount your root partition
mount /dev/discs/disc0/part1 /mnt
copy the older version of udev accross.
cp /src/projectdev/pkg/udev-036-1.pkg.tar.gz /mnt
change root
chroot /mnt
downgrade the pkg
pacman --upgrade udev-036-1.pkg.tar.gz
exit the chroot
umount /mnt
reboot

all been well you should be back up and running in about 10 mins.
Thanks
Mogwa_

Subject: [Projectdev-devel] Test CVS is now "current"
Message-ID: <41BAE791.5050608@email.it>

Yesterday dpb and I decided to finally switch to my "test" CVS tree.
It contains four directories atm: base, desktop, cvs and extra.
BASE contains all the stuff which will go in the base ISOs, so that now 
it will be easier to build them.
DESKTOP contains all the libraries and applications needed to get a 
complete working desktop environment, including X, except for CVS apps.
CVS will be a special repository: we will set "current" as pkgver for 
all CVS apps and put the build date in description; CVS binaries will be 
built only for new releases, and if a user wants to rebuild all CVS apps 
and libs with latest stuff, he'll use devcheck+makepkg or srcpac.
EXTRA, well... extra contains all the stuff which is not part of base, 
desktop or cvs ;)
Just checkout "current" module to get all this.
dpb has already modified his "mkdb" script for the new ftp and cvs 
layout. Another little change we made is to put binary package 
repositories into the "packages" directory.
We are going to rebuild pacman as soon as possible.
