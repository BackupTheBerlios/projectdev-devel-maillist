Subject: [Projectdev-devel] Live CD and other stuff
Message-ID: <41DAFFE4.6090207@burningfrog.be>

Yo ,


I've made a livecd install ISO CD  that still needs a lot of hacking.
The idea is to use this one to install and build newer packages. It's
alot easier to build ISO's this way then we did it the previous way.

Also here a fast howto  for using CVS and building packages.


bash-3.00$ cat projectdev_howto.txt
version 0.1
Auther: Blokkie <t.fernagut at burningfrog.be>

If you have a developers account use your dev-account name where is needed.

CVS
---

First we export our CVS env :

$ export CVS_RSH=ssh <enter>


Logging in :

Anonymous :
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous at cvs.projectdev.berlios.de:/cvsroot/projectdev
login  <enter>
for anonymous  there is no password so you can just hit <enter> again. 

Developers :
$ cvs -d:pserver:USERNAME at cvs.projectdev.berlios.de:/cvsroot/projectdev
login <enter>
enter your passwd

Getting the cvs repository :

Anonymous :
$ cvs -z3
-d:pserver:anonymous at cvs.projectdev.berlios.de:/cvsroot/projectdev co
current <enter>

Developers :
$ cvs -z3
-d:pserver:USERNAME at cvs.projectdev.berlios.de:/cvsroot/projectdev co
current <enter>


The rest of this document only apply's to developers

Whenever you want do do something on the CVS  don't forget to export
CVS_RSH=ssh (or put it in your profile localy)

Now we want to hack something up, rebuild a package or whatever , make
sure you update your local cvs-repository :

$ export CVS_RSH=ssh
$ cd /path/to/your/local/cvs/current
$ cvs update


There , now it's up to date.  Say you want to rebuild a package like
nano coz there is a new version available for example.

$ cd  /path/to/your/local/cvs/current
$ cd /base/editors/nano/
$ ls
CVS  PKGBUILD
$ vi PKGBUILD

Now you change whatever needs to be changed and you save it . For example

pkgname=nano
pkgver=1.2.4
pkgrel=2

will be :

pkgname=nano
pkgver=1.2.6
pkgrel=1


First we want to build it and check if it's actually working and
building. So we do :

$ makepkg

This will fetch the source and compile and package nano as you have
defined in the PKGBUILD
Also .. if there is a new version you prolly need to make new md5sums.
Otherwise makepkg's checksum won't pass. Add the new checksum like this :

$ makepkg -g >> PKGBUILD
$ vi PKGBUILD

Remove the old md5 and put the new md5 where it should be


Let's say that the build works nicely and there is a sweet new
nano-1.2.6-1.pkg.tar.gz  in your dir. First thing to do is test the app,
see if it works :

$ pacman -A nano-1.2.6-1.pkg.tar.gz  (if it's not yet installed)
$ pacman -U nano-1.2.6-1.pkg.tar.gz  (to upgrade the existing nano)

If that all works fine we can now commit our new PKGBUILD and other
neccesarry files to the CVS-repository so other developers can use your
PKGBUILD too :

$ cd /path/to/your/local/cvs/current/base/editors/nano/
$ CVS add -m "New PKGBUILD - version 1.2.6" PKGBUILD  (if it did not exist)
$ CVS commit -m "New PKGBUILD - version 1.2.6" PKGBUILD (if it was there
and your version needs to replace it)

In both cases it will ask for your developers passwd .


Uploading your package.pkg.tar.gz :

$ scp nano-1.2.6-1.pkg.tar.gz
USERNAME at shell.berlios.de:/home/groups/ftp/pub/projectdev/current  
Keep in mind that you put it in the correct dir otherwise pacman's
rebuildb won't work

Next we need to change the perms of the file in the ftp dir otherwise
nobody else will be able to delete/move/replace it:

$ ssh USERNAME at shell.berlios.de
$ cd /home/groups/ftp/pub/projectdev/current
$ chmod 664 nano-1.2.6-1.pkg.tar.gz


Don't exit now coz you still need to rerun mkdb so all ProjectDEV users
will be able to automagicly fetch your fresh build package :

$ /home/groups/projectdev/htdocs/mkdb current

There ...  you will see a hole heap of stuff scrolling but be sure that
there is no error at the end .


That's it for now :-)

Hi. :)

I added you to the developer list. You should have access to cvs 
in a few hours, when the berlios cronjobs update the permissions.

You might need to login to shell.berlios.de first to activate 
your shell account (if you haven't done it already).

To help plug the various bugs and vulnerabilities that have recently
been cropping up in the 2.6 kernels, we've decided to try out the new
-as[1] patchset by Andres Salomon. As he wrote[2] on the lkml, this patchset
will fix the "obvious" bugs and vulnerabilities in the mainline kernel,
in an effort to provide a solid base kernel for distributions to use.

This patchset does not add any new features or drivers -- it is just a
comprehensive collection of fixes that should be included in the vanilla
kernel anyway.

Report any problems or concerns to Mr. Bugtracker.
